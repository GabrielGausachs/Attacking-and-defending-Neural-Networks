# Attacking-and-defending-Neural-Networks
This repository demonstrates the implementation of adversarial attacks and defenses using a pretrained ResNet18 model on the ImageNet1k_V1 dataset. It includes the generation of adversarial examples with the Basic Iterative Method (BIM) and the deployment of an autoencoder-based defense to mitigate the impact of such attacks.
